# CountDuplicateNumber

It's a very "simple" program. User enters 10 numbers(you can change this value to whatever you want, or ever better, you can create a dynamic array for your purpose), then it's sorting the array, and after that it counts and finds how many times, there is repeated number. Notice, it only works, for 1 repeated number.
